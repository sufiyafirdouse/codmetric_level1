Concerning the Project
This Python programming-focused project was created as a component of my internship selection at CodMetric. Demonstrating function-based logic, clear code structure, and useful use cases was the aim.
🔧 What It Does?
✅ It carries out simple mathematical operations:
 - Addition
- Subtraction 
- Multiplication
- Division (with divide-by-zero error handling)
✅ Menu-driven interface for ongoing computations
✅ Gently handles invalid numeric input

🧠 What I Discovered
Creating Python functions that are reusable
Try-except blocks are used to handle exceptions.
- Conditional logic and loops for user interaction
Constructing an intuitive console application
🌟 The Significance of This
As I develop into a creative Python developer, this task demonstrates my command of the language and my capacity to create clear, user-focused logic in fintech-style environments.
